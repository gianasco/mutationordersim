# mutationorder
Mathematica code for simulating the evolution of populations of cancer cells subjected to driver, non-driver and metabolic mutations under various dynamic conditions. The underlying program is a CA model running a large population of agents moving around in a space given by the cell mutational states and the hosting compartment.   

#### Mathematica Graphic Interface
Mathematica offers the possibility command Manipulat to create suitable interactive interfaces allowing the user to change the analytical and numerical parameters of an algorithm.
We have crated a set of interfaces to study different dynamical aspects in the evolution of populations of cancer cells such as the variation of the cancer stemness, the number of driver, the number of non-driver mutations, and the number of metabolic mutations, the effect of each driver mutation on the fitness of a cell, and the number of cell populations.
